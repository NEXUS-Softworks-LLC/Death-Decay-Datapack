# Death Decay Datapack

This datapack will temporarily reduce a player's maximum health on death.

Two full hearts will be removed from the player each time they die, until they reach 4 hearts.

Each heart takes 15 minutes to regenerate. The time can be reduced by a minute and 30 seconds by killing any hostile mob.
